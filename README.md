# self-replicating-malware
a project which used Win32 API functions to create zombie processes and threads and replicate itself to other directories.

Unfortunately it went through development hell, and i gave up on trying to fix all the bugs that kept arising in every new build in MS Visual 2019 .

There are still some salvegable parts which i take pride :

- the zombie process creator which creates processes with fake names.
- the module which executes command line inputs to disable windows defender and wlan.
- the general complexity of the program (also exactly what killed my interest to further develop it).
